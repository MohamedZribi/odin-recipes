        <h2>This perfectly creamy lobster risotto!</h2>
        <p>You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here are a few tips for making the best homemade risotto every time</p>
        <p>Risotto is typically served as a side dish. But, since this satisfying dish contains meaty lobster, we think it would work perfectly well as an entree. Pair the lobster risotto with one of these top-rated sides</p>
        <h2>ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>Vegetables</li>
            <li>Broth</li>
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>wine</li>
            <li>Honey</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Cream</li>
            <li>Seasonings</li>
            <li>Lobster</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir the risotto often, but not constantly. If you stir the rice too much, it will become gluey. If you don't stir it enough, though, it won't be creamy and it will stick to the bottom and burn.</li>
            <li>· Make sure the chicken broth is warm or at least room temperature before you add it to the rice. Cold liquid won't cook through as well.</li>
            <li>· Use a pot that fits just over the burner. If the pot is too wide, the rice will cook in a thin layer. This isn't ideal for creamy, rich risotto.</li>
        </ol>
